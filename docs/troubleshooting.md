# Troubleshooting

## Invalid API key

Make sure the key starts with it_ and is copied exactly. You can reissue keys from:

- https://dashboard.instatunnel.my

## Tunnel not starting

- Check that the local port is reachable.
- Try a different port.

## Custom subdomain unavailable

Subdomains are shared. Pick a unique name or try again later.

## Webhooks not reaching local app

- Confirm your local server is running.
- Check firewall settings.
- Use curl locally to verify the endpoint.
